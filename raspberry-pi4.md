# Raspberry PI 4 Model B

## Serial connection
Serial TX and RX are located at GPIO pins 14 and 15 respectively. GPIO pin numbers are different from the numbers in the circles below. I am calling the 
numbers in circles "Board Side" to avoid confusion.

![Screenshot 2022-05-27 120900](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22774472/170775307-8da69ea6-1777-4664-b4f0-11e535bcc23f.jpg)

We are using the adafruit serial to USB cable.
| Color | Cable Side | Board Side | GPIO |
|-------|------------|------------| -----|
| Green |     TX    | RX  - Pin 10| GPIO 15 - UART_ RXD |
| White |     RX    | TX  - Pin 08| GPIO 14 - UART_ TXD |
| Black |     GND   | GND - Pin 06| NA |

```bash
sudo picocom -b 115200 -f n /dev/ttyUSB0
```
## U-Boot

Right now, the default U-Boot will not successfully boot an seL4 image
on the RPi4 because of cache configuration issues in the seL4
ELFLoader. This problem can be remedied by having U-boot disable caches
before loading seL4. Unfortunately, the stock upstream U-boot used to
disable caches before loading the kernel image, but as of this patch
(<https://github.com/u-boot/u-boot/commit/995eab8b5b580b67394312b1621c60a71042cd18>),
U-boot no longer disables caches.

In order to obtain a U-boot binary that disables caching, you should
compile U-Boot from source yourself.
You can do this by cloning U-boot from upstream,
then reverting commit 995eab8b5b580b67394312b1621c60a71042cd18, and then
building it:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/u-boot/u-boot.git u-boot
cd u-boot
git checkout  v2021.10
git revert 995eab8b5b580b67394312b1621c60a71042cd18
make CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- rpi_4_defconfig
make CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-
```

This will enable you to get the most up-to-date U-boot which will boot
seL4 on the RPi4 successfully.

**NOTE:** Automatic revert is not going to work if you are using the
latest version of u-boot. You need to manually revert the change by
looking at the changeset.


## SD card setup
 The PI boots from the first FAT32 partition on the
SD card. Where files are specified, they should be located in the root
directory of this partition.

NOTE: There is no need for it to bootable, that does not matter on arm.

## Getting seL4 onto your Raspberry Pi 4

Because you have applied a device tree overlay to use the UART on GPIO pins 14 and 15,
you will have to update seL4 to use serial0 instead of serial1.
In the kernel at `src/plat/bcm2711/overlay-rpi4.dts`, you should replace all instances of
`serial1` with `serial0`.

Then, you should then build the kernel, such as in seL4test:

```bash
repo init -u https://github.com/seL4/sel4test-manifest.git
repo sync
mkdir cbuild
cd cbuild
../init-build.sh -DPLATFORM=rpi4 -DAARCH64=1
# The default cmake wrapper sets up a default configuration for the target platform.
# To change individual settings, run `ccmake` and change the configuration
# parameters to suit your needs.
ninja
```


The boot method described here is through the SD card. You should set up the files
on your SD card as described in the previous section.

Following this, copy your seL4 image (such as an seL4test image) onto
the SD card in its root directory. You can now remove the SD
card from your PC and re-insert it into the RPi4, and power the RPi4 on.

When the RPi4 boots up, be sure to interrupt the boot process and drop
into the U-boot command prompt. From the U-boot command prompt, type
something like the following: `fatls mmc 0`. If you don't see your seL4 image
filename printed out, then you might need to double-check your steps
so far to make sure you didn't forget something along the way. If you
see your file listed, then do something like:
```
fatload mmc 0 0x1000000 sel4test-driver-image-arm-bcm2711
bootefi 0x1000000
```

Additionally I add a boot.scr file that automates loading and booting the image. 
First create boot.txt with the commands below.

```bash
fatload mmc 0 0x1000000 sel4test-driver-image-arm-bcm2711
bootelf 0x1000000
```
Then use mkimage from the u-boot source tree:
```bash
./tools/mkimage -A arm -O linux -T script -C none -n boot.scr -d boot.txt boot.scr
```
Copy boot.scr to the SD card.
